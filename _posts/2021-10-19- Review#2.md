### Summary:

This project is virtual the (above pictured) Victorian Home of John Ashbery, 1927-2017.  John Ashbery was an important American poet and critic. His legacy was known as being one of the most influential poets in American history. This project includes a narrated walk-through experience of a virtual tour that connects his life and work to his living space. As you click through the house, there are options to click on icons that explain the relevance of that item. The double arrows bring you to the next room and so on throughout the home.  


### Design & Credits: 

This project uses Yale Digital Humanities Lab, Yale ITS and VR Habitat, and 360 photography, panoramas and still photos. On the bottom of the Introduction page, you can see the breakdown of the raw code that was used to create the project as well. 
The sources used for this project came from The Poetry Foundation, Yale Digital Humanities Lab, Tibor de Nagy Gallery, Yale Media and broadcasting Center, A. Whitney Griswold Funds, Pierre Alferi, Guy Maddin, and Open Road Media. 
 
### Relevance: 

The project depicts the physical house, and the items and rooms that John Ashbery used in his life. Since John Ashbery was such an influential figure, the opportunity to be able to see what his daily life would’ve looked like and to “walk” through his house is very special. This is relevant to the grant project that my team will be working on as well since the grant project will be focused on recreating the historical buildings and bringing in new digital elements. The idea of adding audio to a project to strengthen the user’s experience, is one that would be very interesting to include.

### Findings: 
This project was very well made. It was interesting to get to experience a virtual walk through a digital project. However, I think that some of the experience can be made better through being able not requiring the introduction to be said each time. Every time you start the tour, you do have an option to skip, but even when you select it, it still makes you listen to some of it which becomes repetitive. 

One of the things I found most unique to this project, from other ones that I researched, was the use of audio clips. There is so much audio incorporated within this project, really personalizing it to John Ashbery. However, in many of the icons, the audio is not very clear/ very muffled. For example, the audio used for “**Parian Ware Vase**” in the Butler’s Pantry. A solution to this would have been gathering clearer data since it is so heavily used throughout the project.  Many of the recordings include crowds cheering and crowd reactions. I think for the purpose of educating the public, these could be replaced with newer narration with clearer messages as to what the item is, and why it is relevant enough to be labeled.

The Music Room was in my opinion, one of the most beautiful rooms in the house. The item “**Ashtray on Dresser**” in the Music Room has two audio recordings that play at the same time. Nine seconds into the audio, it splits into two separate recordings. Both male and female voices overlap, causing it to be incredibly difficult to understand what is being said. The first nine seconds was the correct clip as it explains that the ashtray is the only Tiffany item in the house. This can be corrected by choosing one audio clip to play first, and the second audio clip could play after.

Also in the music room, the “**Foyer Chair**” has the wrong image attached. The chair shown in the walk-through, is a rounded green cushioned chair. The chair pictured in the icon shows a stiff wooden squared chair. With a project as this large, it is important to make sure that all the information attached is updated and correct. They do include the correct audio to match the picture. 


### Conclusion:
Overall, this project is very well made. It is a simple to use project that inhibits a lot of unique aspects, such as audio recordings. While searching for a project to review, many blended in with each other, not differentiating themselves and being quite bland. However, I feel that this project is one kind. The faults in this project are reletively easy to correct. The amount of work that went into creating such a large project does not go unrecognized.
