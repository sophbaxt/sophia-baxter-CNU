### Summary:

This project is virtual the (above pictured) Victorian Home of John Ashbery, 1927-2017.  John Ashbery was an important American poet and critic. His legacy was known as being one of the most influential poets in American history. This project includes a narrated walk through experience of a virtual tour that connects his life and work to his living space. As you click through the house, there are options to click on icons that explain the relevance of that item. The double arrows bring you to the next room and so on throughout the home.  Below is an image of one of the selectable icons that included more information about the specific item.

### Design: 

This project uses Yale Digital Humanities Lab, Yale ITS and VR Habitat, and 360 photography, panoramas and still photos. On the bottom of the Introduction page, you can see the breakdown of the raw code that was used to create the project as well. 
 
### Relevance: 

The project depicts the physical house, and the items and rooms that John Ashbery used in his life. Since John Ashbery was such an influential figure, the opportunity to be able to see what his daily life would’ve looked like and to “walk” through his house is very special. This is relevant to the grant project that my team will be working on as well since the grant project will be focused on recreating the historical buildings and bringing in new digital elements. The idea of adding audio to a project in order to strengthen the user’s experience, is one that would be very interesting to include.

### Findings: 
This project was very well made. It was really interesting to get to experience a virtual walk through through a digital project. However, I think that some of the experience can be made better through being able not requiring the introduction to be said each time. Everytime you start the tour, you do have an option to skip, but even when you select it, it still makes you listen to some of it. The “Special Thanks” tab shares a lot of the same information as the “Project Staff” tab, so the could’ve consolidated the too and thanked the staff and the other people in one while giving credit.
