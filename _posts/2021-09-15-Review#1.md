**Summary**
This project's data comes from a tool from 1936- 1966, The Negro Motorist Green Book. Victor Green, who was a postal worker at the time created this book. Green documented safe stops for black travelers during his work travels across America. These included everything from hotels and restaurants to bars and nightclubs. This tool allowed guidance to safety and rest for people of color. The director of this project, Brian Foo, referenced NYPL Labs and Digital Collections data. Foo is both a data visualization artist and a computer scientist. He creates interactive and physical exhibits of many different topic structures. Foo's history creating DH projects definitely was useful while creating Navigating the Green Book.

**Design**
This project uses CSS, JavaScript, HTML, and Python. These applications allow the site to maneuver. The map works through choosing a year, and two addresses. The selection options for the year include one before and one after desegregation. creates a road trip/ GPS route with safe restaurants every 250 miles and lodging every 750 miles.

**Relevance** 
This project depicts and improves upon the accessibility of a physical item (The Green Book) which saved so many lives. The two options when starting to use the interactive map are before and after desegregation was passed. It shows the increase in the number of safety hubs offered and increasing demand for these locations. This relates to the humanities through tying in the historical and ethnic studies subjects. One way to define ‘humanities’ is the study of human culture. This map shows the effect of desegregation and the increasing number of safe places offered. Brian Foo hyperlinks his contact information, alternate projects, and press events.

**Findings**
Navigating the Green Book is very made. Both maps are unique and interactive. The amount of information and data you can see from these maps is very extensive. Every location has safe places and detailed information about each specific location. One major critique of this project is the cellphone version. When interacting with the two maps on a cellphone, the information overlaps with a huge part of the map. This makes it very difficult to see the route from the interactive map. The 'Heatmap' also lags as you’re zooming in and out of the map, which makes it more difficult to understand. The maps zoom features on mobile devices are very touch sensitive. This allows it to appear as though the screen is glitching or uncentered. One solution would be to update the zoom feature not to change based on touch for more precise searching. The data presented came from in depth research showing the director’s focus and coding ability. The “Heatmap View” is difficult to understand and differentiate between the colors due to lacking a key. It shows the concentration differences but does not explain the importance of each color.  Since so many people were impacted by The Green Book, it would be interesting to see more personal stories shared. Stories tying the places to the experiences would also help grab people’s attention. People may have more desire to stay using the navigation maps and share the site with others. 

**Credit**
The sources used to pull information for this project came from Paul Beaudion, Josh Hadro, Matt Miller, Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture, SC Digital Academy, and the University of South Carolina. Specific data about the locations shown and entries in The NYPL Labs database and high-resolution images of The Negro Motorist Green Book: 1947. Data was also used from The Negro Travelers’ Green Book: Spring 1956 by SC Digital Academy.
