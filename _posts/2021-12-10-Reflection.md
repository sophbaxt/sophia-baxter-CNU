##  The Class/Course itself  ##
Overall, this course was very educational and eye opening. Before taking this writing class, I assumed that it would be exhausting for the students through requiring long readings on chapters and typing lengthy papers on topics that most students do not have interest in. However, this writing class focused on improving our writing skills while centralizing on a topic that is involved in everyone’s daily life, digital humanities (DH). This course allowed for me to be able to create my own definition of what “digital humanities” means to me. My definition of DH is _“digital humanities are the combination of digital and analog projects using interactive features to share a purpose of education for self or society. This is done through analyzing humanistic topics and brings physical and intangible items greater purpose.”_ This reflection will go in chronological order of the following topics based on submission.

## Readings ##
My situation as a student was slightly different from others in the class. I had the opportunity to take this course at the same time as the IDST 270 course, I gained exposure to twice as many readings and education on the digital humanities. Because of this, I got to discuss some of the readings that were shared between both classes. The reading that I enjoyed the most from this class was one that was also shared in the other class, Jason Heppler’s “What Is Digital Humanities?”. This project defined _'digital humanities'_ in thousands of ways using an interactive platform to showcase a new DH definition with each click of the “refresh” button for the website. This reading helped me in the beginning of the class understand how broad and diverse the digital humanities can be.


## Assignments ##

#### Twitter
Tweeting every week three times a week was a great way to reflect on important things covered and what we as students learned from them. It was a fun and engaging way to use social media to connect and share individual or group accomplishments, and to reply to other people after reading about what they accomplished. Below is a picture of an example of one of my favorite tweets. This tweet talked about a reading I found particularly useful, and that I still use often when writing online, _The Hemingway App_.

#### About Me Blog
The About Me Blog was one of the harder assignments at the time for me because this assignment was the introduction piece to see what was expected from the student, and the first time that students were using GitHub. For this reason alone, I believe that it would’ve been beneficial to possible do a practice blog or nongraded assignment as the first GitHub project. Other than that, I enjoyed doing the blog and picked up on ways to do things along the way. 

#### Review #1
This review was one I really enjoyed creating because I really enjoyed the topic that I chose, _Navigating the Green Book._ After having the feedback from the previous blog, this was a time where I could show that I was improving my GitHub skills alongside my writing and my technical skills. 
#### CNU Assignment
The CNU Assignment was created using ThingLink. I loved being about to choose my topic, my highlights from freshmen year shared through their locations on a map of CNU. ThingLink was such a great exposure to working on an interactive site that I continued after this project with using it for other class assignments. The technology was easy to pick up and learn, while still creating an amazing interactive platform. 

#### Review #2
My second review was very in-depth and I certainly my own personal growth that was apparent through understanding this assignment more clearly than the first review. However, finding the topic to review was challenging as many projects I found were not as interesting or had issues when used. The virtual walk-through technology and the amount of work that went into creating this DH project was incredible and very clear when critiquing the piece.

#### Grant
The Grant Project was an assignment that built upon itself for a long time throughout the ending part of the semester. This assignment was very resourceful and a direct example of what a real Grant proposal would look like. Originally, my group thought that with this project being stretched across so many classes, that we were supposed to be trying to attempt to implement the grant into creating a DH project of our own. Luckily, we consulted to find out that the project was not as difficult as we had made it out to be and instead of creating a mockup of the grant without purpose, we were able to include it into our grant project as a mock-up to help visualize what our mission was.  As shown in the image above.
