## "The Sophia Story"

* As a junior at Christopher Newport University (CNU), I am busy studying to achieve a major in Business Management and a minor in Digital Humanities. This decision has been a long one in the making, especially since I originally applied to CNU with a biology/ pre-med interest. I quickly realized that the mathematical and critical thinking courses were of more interest to me. Accounting, Statistics, and Ethical Issues in Business were a few of my favorite classes I have taken so far. The professors here at CNU influenced my decision to change majors, by seeing potential in me to be in the business field. After my freshman year, I was nominated by one of my professors to be the Intensive Learning Community Peer Mentor for Business Students. Any incoming student interested in business as a major could come to me for study skills, learning workshops, or scholarly advice. This job inspired my interest in problem-solving, recruitment, and interpersonal communication. My current career aspiration is to go into Hospital Administrations where I can use these key skills daily to make a bigger and better impact in others’ lives.
#### Campus Involvements
* I’m involved in the **__Captain's Educational Enrichment Fund__** [CEE Fund!](https://www.cnuceefund.com/) and Greek life on campus. The CEE Fund manages and invests over $650,000 worth of investments into building a profitable, creative and diverse financial analysis portfolio. This hands-on experience has helped me see what a job in business would look like, and network with other students or professionals with similar interests. My involvement in greek life is specifically Alpha Phi, where I am the Director of Formal Recruitment and take part in philanthropies such as Fear 2 Freedom and the Alpha Phi Foundation. These philanthropies keep me actively working with the community raising awareness for women's heart health and helping sexual assault survivors. Through these activities, I have been able to have a full college experience even with COVID taking away many of the expected college pros. Even at school considerably smaller than many others,  I am constantly able to meet new faces on campus and build relationships with people of every interest and background. 
* At home, I have three pets. 
1. My favorite is named Mr. Kitty, and he is a silver and black fancy American shorthair. 

2. He has been one of my biggest emotional support factors ever since I was in third grade. My family has a cat named Bentley (**AKA Fluffy**) who we adopted 4 years ago.

3. Our last pet is a big standard poodle, Spencer, but everyone always asks us if he is a golden doodle because he is so furry. 
Family is _really_ important to me. I have a twin brother named Julian who __also__ attends CNU. It was such a funny coincidence when we both realized that CNU was both of our top picks and then we were both accepting enrollments to attend! I have a sister named Bebe who goes to school at VA Tech. Finally, I have another brother, David, who is all finished with school and has a full family at home. My family is very close and now with my oldest brother's two additions, Svea and Alice, we can make family time an even bigger priority.
